            <p>How is it that one man can be so cool, yet so completely lame in the same moment? It's simple, really. Dedication and commitment to excellence.<br>Through tribulation and trials, I've developed a lifestyle condusive to maintaining excellence. If you've never binged an entire series in one day, I've got some sad, sad news for you. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers. Gotta pump them numbers.</p>

                See above. Also, if you don't listen to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony you've no business on this site, you've got a long way to go before any of this ascendant wisdom will actually take root and bloom into a beautiful butterfly.<br>

            <p>My name is Aidan Bateman, and I'm 29 years of age. I've been doing construction for majority of a decade now (which I think is rather handy life-skill wise). As they say, all good things must come to an end, hence my journey as a laborer is at nearing it's conclusion. Hence my presence in the bootcamp. I hope to learn a lot and have an enjoyable time, I'm even thinking I might just pick up a snazzy new mechanical keyboard just so the sound of my constant typing will be ever-so slightly less grating. Wish me luck.</p>
